# Digit-Recognition
The is my code for MNIST dataset digit recognition model

The dataset has been loaded using tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist()

The model has been trained using grayscale images of handwritten texts with 32 Kernels and Max Pooling of 2x2
Finally, I improved the model to increase the accuracy from 98% to 99.3%
